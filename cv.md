### Code example

**Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light from CODEWARS:** 

*You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from  `green`, to  `yellow`, to  `red`, and then to  `green`  again.
Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.* 
```

    function updateLight(current) {
    
      switch (current) {
        case 'green':
          return 'yellow';
          break;
        case 'yellow':
          return 'red';
